# Cyber Security: Security Operations Center (SOC) vs. Network Operations Center (NOC)

<https://www.intellectualpoint.com/blog/cyber-security-security-operations-center-soc-vs-network-operations-center-noc/>

Everyday cyber security professionals go to work without any idea about the identity and probable actions of their adversaries. In information security, just as on the military battlefield, if you do not understand the motivations, intentions and competencies of your opponents, then you cannot understand the risks to your enterprise or focus on your defenses.
Even after all the recent data breaches and hacking incidents, many people, companies and organizations still disregard major security protocols and fail to understand that cyber security is a discipline where cyber criminals and hacktivists are always a step ahead.
There are several ways by which a company or an organization defends against a cyber attack. Many companies have adopted the “monitor and response” strategy. This strategy recognizes that simply a signature-based defense won’t be effective against sophisticated targeted attacks. This generally takes place in a Security Operations Center (SOC) or a Network Operations Center (NOC). In most organizations the SOC and NOC run together, but separately.
There are some similarities between the role of the Network Operation Center (NOC) and Security Operation Center (SOC); however, often this leads to the mistaken idea that one can easily handle the other’s duties. This couldn’t be further from the truth.
So why can’t the NOC just handle both functions? Why should each SOC and NOC work separately, but operate in conjunction with one another?
First, the roles of SOC and NOC are subtly but fundamentally different. While it is true that both SOC and NOC are responsible for identifying, investigating, prioritizing, escalating and resolving issues, the types of issues and the impact they have are considerably different.
The NOC is responsible for handling incidents that affect performance or availability while the SOC handles those incidents that affect the security of information assets.
Both SOC and NOC are involved in risk management and risk mitigation; however, the way they accomplish this goal is different.
The NOC’s job is to meet service level agreements (SLAs) and manage incidents in a way that reduces downtime. It focuses on availability and performance.
The SOC, however, is in charge of protecting intellectual property and sensitive customer data – a focus on security.
While both of these things are critically important to any organization, combining the SOC and NOC into one entity and having them each handle the other’s duties can spell disaster – because their approaches are so different.
Another reason the NOC and SOC should not be combined is because their skill sets are different.
A NOC analyst must be proficient in network, application and systems engineering, while SOC analysts require security-engineering skills.
Last but not least, the very nature of the adversaries that each group tackles is different. The SOC focuses on “intelligent adversaries” while the NOC deals with naturally occurring system events.
These are completely different directions, which result in contrasting solutions. Consequently, both SOC and NOC are needed to work side-by-side but in conjunction with one another.

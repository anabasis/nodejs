# How to work with users, roles, and storage passwords using the Splunk SDK for Python

With the Splunk SDKs, you can manage who can access your Splunk Enterprise system and control what they can do by setting up users and assigning them roles. You can also manage secure credentials, or storage passwords.

This topic contains the following sections:

- Users, roles, and passwords
- The user and password APIs
- Code examples
- Parameter tables

## Users, roles, and passwords

This section provides a brief overview of users, roles, and storage passwords in Splunk Enterprise:

- Users
- Roles
- Storage passwords

### Users

Splunk has a single default user ("admin"), and if you are running Splunk Enterprise, you can add more users (Splunk Free doesn't support user authentication). For each new user you add to your Splunk Enterprise system, you can specify:

- A username and password
- A full name
- An email address
- A default time zone
- A default app
- One or more roles to control what the user can do

### Roles

Roles specify what the user is allowed to do in Splunk Enterprise. Splunk Enterprise includes predefined roles that you can modify, or you can create new roles. The predefined roles are:

- **admin** : This role has the most capabilities.
- **power** : This role can edit all shared objects and alerts, tag events, and other similar tasks.
- **user** : This role can create and edit its own saved searches, run searches, edit preferences, create and edit event types, and other similar tasks.
- **can_delete** : This role has the single capability of deleting by keyword, which is required for using the delete search operator.
- **splunk-system-role** : This role is based on admin, but has more restrictions on searches and jobs.

Each role is defined by a combination of these permissions and restrictions:

- Capabilities, which specify the system settings and resources the user is allowed to view or modify. For example, you could allow users to list data inputs but not edit them. For a full list of capabilities, see Capabilities, below.
- Restrictions on searches and search jobs. For example, you can set a limit on the number of concurrent search jobs the user can run, or restrict the data that the user can search by setting a search filter.
- Allowed indexes, to explicitly specify which indexes the user is allowed to search.
- Indexes to search by default.
- Other roles to inherit properties from.

When you inherit other roles, their capabilities, restrictions, and properties are not merged with those of the current role, but rather they are maintained separately. For example, if you list capabilities of a role, its inherited capabilities are not listedâ€”you must explicitly request a list of inherited capabilities. When a role is modified, the changes are made automatically where ever the role is inherited.
You can also assign one or more roles to each user. When multiple roles are assigned, the broadest permissions from these roles are given. Specifically, the user's permissions are the union of all capabilities and the intersection of the restrictions.

### Storage passwords

Storage passwords in Splunk Enterprise allow for management of secure credentials. The password is encrypted with a secret key that resides on the same machine. The clear text passwords can be accessed by users who have access to this service. Only users in the admin role can access storage passwords.

## The user, role, and storage password APIs

To work with users, roles, and storage passwords in the Splunk SDK for Python, use these classes through an instance of the [splunklib.client.Service](http://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/PythonSDK/1.6.5/client.html#splunklib.client.Service) class:

The [splunklib.client.User](http://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/PythonSDK/1.6.5/client.html#splunklib.client.User) class for an individual user.
The [splunklib.client.Users](http://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/PythonSDK/1.6.5/client.html#splunklib.client.Users) class for the collection of users.
The [splunklib.client.Role](http://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/PythonSDK/1.6.5/client.html#splunklib.client.Role) class for an individual role.
The [splunklib.client.Roles](http://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/PythonSDK/1.6.5/client.html#splunklib.client.Roles) class for the collection of roles.
The [splunklib.client.StoragePassword](http://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/PythonSDK/1.6.5/client.html#splunklib.client.StoragePassword) class for an individual storage password.
The [splunklib.client.StoragePasswords](http://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/PythonSDK/1.6.5/client.html#splunklib.client.StoragePasswords) class for the collection of storage passwords.

Retrieve a collection, and from there you can access individual items in the collection and create new ones. For example, here's a simplified program for getting a collection of users and creating a new one:

```python
# Connect to Splunk
service = client.connect(...)

# Get the collection of users
users = service.users

# Create a user
user = service.users.create(<em>username</em>, <em>password</em>, <em>roles</em>)
```

## Code examples

This section provides examples of how to use the users, roles, and storage password APIs, assuming you first [connect to a Splunk instance](http://dev.splunk.com/view/python-sdk/SP-CAAAEE4):

- To list users and display properties
- To add a new user and modify properties
- To get the current user
- To list roles and display properties
- To create a new role and modify properties
- To create a new storage password
- To list storage passwords

### To list users and display properties

This example shows how to use the [splunklib.client.Users](http://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/PythonSDK/1.6.5/client.html#splunklib.client.Users) class to retrieve the collection of users that have been added to your Splunk system and list them, sorted by the realname field. This example also retrieves a few properties for each user, including their roles. For a list of available parameters to use when retrieving a collection, see [Collection parameters](http://dev.splunk.com/view/python-sdk/SP-CAAAEJ6#getcollparams).

```python
# Get the collection of users, sorted by realname
kwargs = {"sort_key":"realname", "sort_dir":"asc"}
users = service.users.list(count=-1,**kwargs)

# Print the users' real names, usernames, and roles
print "Users:"
for user in users:
    print "%s (%s)" % (user.realname, user.name)
    for role in user.role_entities:
        print " - ", role.name
```

### To add a new user and modify properties

This example shows how to create a new user. At a minimum, provide a username and password, and specify one or more roles. You can also specify additional properties for the user at the same time by providing a dictionary of key-value pairs for the properties (the possible properties are summarized in [User authentication parameters](http://dev.splunk.com/view/python-sdk/SP-CAAAEJ6#userauthparams)). Or, modify properties after you have created the user.
Note that when you set properties, the new values overwrite any existing ones. For example, if you set a role, it replaces any existing roles already assigned to the user.

```python
# Create a new user
newuser = service.users.create(username="testuser",
                            password="yourpassword",
                            roles=["power","user"])
# Print the user's properties
print "Properties of the new user '" + newuser.name + "':\n"
print "Full name:  ", newuser["realname"]
print "Default app:", newuser["defaultApp"]
print "Time zone:  ", newuser["tz"]
print "Role:"
# Print the roles for the user
for role in newuser.role_entities:
    print " - ", role.name

# Change some properties and update the server
kwargs = {"realname": "Test User",
          "defaultApp": "launcher",
          "tz": "Europe/Paris",
          "roles":"can_delete"}
newuser.update(**kwargs).refresh()

# Print updated info
print "\nUpdated properties:"
print "Full name:  ", newuser["realname"]
print "Default app:", newuser["defaultApp"]
print "Time zone:  ", newuser["tz"]
print "Role:"
# Print the roles for the user
for role in newuser.role_entities:
    print " - ", role.name
```

### To get the current user

This example shows how to find out which user is currently logged in.

```python
# Get the current user
print "The current user is", service.username
```

### To list roles and display properties

This example shows how to use the [splunklib.client.Roles](http://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/PythonSDK/1.6.5/client.html#splunklib.client.Roles) class to retrieve the collection of roles that have been configured for Splunk and list them along with their capabilities. For a list of available parameters to use when retrieving a collection, see [Collection parameters](http://dev.splunk.com/view/python-sdk/SP-CAAAEJ6#getcollparams).

```python
# Get the collection of roles
roles = service.roles
print "There are %s roles" % (len(roles))

# Display the name of each role and its capabilities
for role in roles:
    print role.name
    for capability in role.capabilities:
        print " - ", capability
    for capability in role.imported_capabilities:
        print " - ", capability, "(imported)"
```

### To create a new role and modify properties

This example shows how to create a new role, then how to import capabilities and properties from existing roles. At a minimum, provide a name for the new role. You can specify additional properties at the same time by providing a dictionary of key-value pairs (the possible parameters are summarized in [Roles parameters](http://dev.splunk.com/view/python-sdk/SP-CAAAEJ6#rolesparams)). Or, modify properties after you have created the role.
Be aware that when you set properties using a dictionary of kwargs, the new values overwrite the existing ones. However, you can use the [splunklib.client.Role.grant](http://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/PythonSDK/1.6.5/client.html#splunklib.client.Role.grant) method to add capabilities to an existing set rather than replace them. Similarly, use the [splunklib.client.Role.revoke](http://docs.splunk.com/DocumentationStatic/PythonSDK/1.6.5/client.html#splunklib.client.Role.revoke) method to remove capabilities from the current set, leaving the rest of the set intact.

```python
# Create a new role called "testrole"
newrole = service.roles.create("testrole")

# Import properties from the 'user' role and update the server
kwargs = {"imported_roles": "user"}
newrole.update(**kwargs).refresh()

# Display the properties of the new role
print "=== Properties of the new role 'testrole' ===\n"
print "Capabilities:"
for capability in newrole.capabilities:
    print " - ", capability
print "Imported roles: ", newrole["imported_roles"]
print "Imported capabilities:"
for capability in newrole.imported_capabilities:
    print " - ", capability
print "Default app: ", newrole["defaultApp"]
print "Search filter: ", newrole["srchFilter"]

# Change the properties
# Note that the imported role "user" is overwritten by "can_delete"
kwargs = {"defaultApp": "launcher",
          "srchFilter": "source=/var/log/*",
          "imported_roles": "can_delete",
          "capabilities": "use_file_operator"
          }
newrole.update(**kwargs).refresh()

# Print updated properties
print "\n\n=== Updated properties using 'update' ===\n"
print "Capabilities:"
for capability in newrole.capabilities:
    print " - ", capability
print "Imported roles: ", newrole["imported_roles"]
print "Imported capabilities:"
for capability in newrole.imported_capabilities:
    print " - ", capability
print "Default app: ", newrole["defaultApp"]
print "Search filter: ", newrole["srchFilter"]


# Add some capabilities using 'grant'
newrole.grant("indexes_edit", "edit_forwarders", "edit_monitor")
newrole.refresh()

# Print updated properties
print "\n\n=== Updated properties using 'grant' ===\n"
print "Capabilities:"
for capability in newrole.capabilities:
    print " - ", capability
print "Imported roles: ", newrole["imported_roles"]
print "Imported capabilities:"
for capability in newrole.imported_capabilities:
    print " - ", capability
print "Default app: ", newrole["defaultApp"]
print "Search filter: ", newrole["srchFilter"]
```

### To create a new storage password

This example shows how to create a new storage password.

```python
service client.connect(...)
storage_passwords = service.storage_passwords

# Create a storage password
storage_password = storage_passwords.create("yourpassword", "someusername", "somerealm")
print "Created storage password with name: " + storage_password.name
```

### To list storage passwords

This example shows how to list the storage passwords visible to the current user.

```python
service client.connect(...)
storage_passwords = service.storage_passwords

# List storage passwords
for storage_password in storage_passwords:
    print storage_password.name
```

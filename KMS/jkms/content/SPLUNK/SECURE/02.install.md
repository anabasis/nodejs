Install Splunk Enterprise securely
To install Splunk Enterprise securely, you must have an installation package that you have confirmed is authentic and has not been modified in any way since Splunk created it. Splunk provides a Message Digest 5 (MD5) secure hash for every package it generates. You can download this hash to quickly verify that the package you downloaded is authentic and has not been changed since its creation.

You can also compare the Secure Hash Algorithm-512 (SHA-512) hashes by opening a case with Splunk Support.

Prerequisites for verifying package integrity
You must have the following to verify the contents of packages you download:

The md5sum program, which prints the hash of the file that you supply, and comes with most versions of Linux. On Windows, you can use the certutil tool to verify MD5 hashes.
Alternatively, the sha512sum program prints SHA512 hashes for the file that you supply.
The MD5 or SHA512 hashes, in text format, which Splunk provide
Access to a shell prompt
Verify installation package integrity
After you download the Splunk Enterprise package, verify it by using a trusted version of the OpenSSL suite to compare the MD5 or SHA-512 hashes to the hash of the installation package. If the hash of the package you downloaded matches the hash that Splunk provides, then you have downloaded a valid, secure installation package and can proceed with installation.

Download Splunk Enterprise installation package and MD5 hash
Confirm that you download the MD5 hash that exactly matches the version of installation package that you downloaded. Downloading a different file results in the hashes not matching.

Go to the Splunk.com download page.
Click Splunk Enterprise.
Click the tab for the operating system that you want to download Splunk software.
Click the Download Now link for the OS version and installation package type that you want to install with.
On the next page that loads, read the Splunk Software License Agreement.
Click the I have read, understood, and hereby accept the Splunk Software License Agreement checkbox.
Click Start your download now. The page refreshes and the download begins.
On the next page that loads, in the Useful tools box, click MD5 to verify. A second file, the MD5 hash, begins to download.
After both downloads finish, complete the "Verify hashes" procedure.
Download Splunk Enterprise installation package and request SHA512 hash from Splunk Support
Complete Steps 1 through 7 of the "Download Splunk Enterprise installation package and MD5 hash" procedure.
Open a case with Splunk Support to receive the SHA512 hash. When you open the case, provide a link to the version, operating system, and type of installation package you downloaded.
After you receive a link to the hash, follow the link to download it.
After the package and SHA512 hash downloads finish, complete the "Verify hashes" procedure.
Verify hashes
After you download the package, verify it by running either the md5sum or sha512sum utilities:

Open a shell prompt.
Change to the directory where you downloaded the installation package and the MD5 hash.
Print the contents of the hash file that you downloaded:
MD5	SHA512
cat splunk-xxxx-release.tgz.md5
cat splunk-xxxx-release.tgz.sha512
Run the md5sum or sha512sum tool on the installation package that you downloaded:
MD5	SHA512
md5sum splunk-xxxx-release.tgz.md5
sha512sum splunk-xxxx-release.tgz.sha512
Compare the output from the MD5 or SHA512 hash file against the result from the md5sum or sha512sum utilities.
If the hashes match exactly, then the package you downloaded is authentic and has not been modified. You can continue with installation.
If the hash does not match, then either the package you downloaded has been modified. Retry the download.
Verify Signatures
You can verify the authenticity of the downloaded RPM package using the Splunk GnuPG Public key as follows

Download the GnuPG Public key file (yes, this link is over TLS).
Install the GnuPG public key:
rpm --import <filename>
Verify the package signature using:
rpm -K <filename>
Proceed with installation from your authenticated installation package
After you have successfully verified your installation package as authentic, you can proceed with installation.

Installation instructions in the Installation Manual


Create secure administrator credentials
When you install Splunk Enterprise, you must create a user name and password for your administrator account. If you do not specify any arguments when you install the software, it prompts you to create a user name and a password during the installation process.

If you do not create the password during installation, an unusable installation can occur. This can happen, for example, if you use the --no-prompt Splunk CLI argument for starting Splunk Enterprise and also do not provide an administrator password in user-seed.conf. In such a case, you must create the administrator credentials manually for the instance to be accessible.

If you upgrade from an older version of Splunk Enterprise, the installation uses the old administrator credentials.

Create admin credentials after starting Splunk Enterprise
If you installed Splunk Enterprise and did not create the administrator credentials, you can use one of the following methods to create the credentials.

Create admin credentials with user-seed.conf
This is currently the most secure method to create administrative credentials. Other methods can introduce security risks, mainly around access to command line history or process output.

Edit the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/user-seed.conf file as follows:
[user_info]
USERNAME = admin
PASSWORD = <your password>
Restart Splunk Enterprise.
Create admin credentials using REST
Administrators with access to the machine file system can create a user and enter a password using the splunkd rest --noauth command.

This method is not secure because the password appears in plain text in the command line history unless you immediately delete the history after running the command.

You must restart Splunk Enterprise after using splunkd REST commands.

$ splunk cmd splunkd rest 
--noauth POST /services/authentication/users 
"name=admin&password=<your password>&roles=admin"
Create admin credentials using the --seed-passwd or --gen-and-print-passwd CLI arguments
This method of creating the credentials is not secure because the password appears in the command line history, process output (ps aux), and other items. Splunk Enterprise does not prompt you to create an administrator username in these cases, and instead uses the default of admin.

Create a password when you start Splunk Enterprise with the --seed-passwd argument:
splunk start --accept-license 
--answer-yes --no-prompt --seed-passwd <your password>
Generate a random password and print the random password immediately:
splunk start --accept-license 
--answer-yes --no-prompt --gen-and-print-passwd
Create admin credentials for automated installations with the 'hash-passwd' CLI command
You can use this method in automated installations where you save and distribute user-seed.conf to the newly installed instances.

This method is secure as long as you delete the command line history after completing the procedure.

Create a hash from a plain-text password.
splunk hash-passwd <plaintext password>
Copy the hash and place it into the user-seed.conf file. For example:
$ splunk hash-passwd <your password>
$6$hf3syG/qxy6REoBp...
You can then be safely write the output of the hash-passwd command in user-seed.conf.

For example:

[user_info]
USERNAME = admin
HASHED_PASSWORD = $6$hf3syG/qxy6REoBp...
To validate a password and make sure it conforms to the password complexity requirements, you can use validate-passwd. For example:
splunk validate-passwd <your password>
cat passwd.txt | splunkd validate-passwd -
$ splunk validate-passwd weakpas
ERROR: Password did not meet complexity requirements. Password must contain at least:
   * 8 total printable ASCII character(s).
Reset a lost password
If you lose or forget the admin password, you can reset it. You must have the ability to write to the underlying password file ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd).

splunk cmd splunkd rest --noauth POST /services/admin/users/admin "password=<your password>"
You must restart Splunk Enterprise after making this change.

Securing Splunk Enterprise with FIPS
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) uses government-certified versions of some algorithms to meet regulatory guidelines. It should not be considered a security enhancement by itself, and might potentially reduce performance on your system. Enable FIPS if it is a regulatory requirement for your environment.

Splunk Enterprise and the Universal Forwarder use an embedded FIPS 140-2-validated cryptographic module (Certificate #3126 Module Version fips-2.0.12) running on various platforms per FIPS 140-2 Implementation Guidance section G.5 guidelines.

The certificate is listed on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) site. See Certificate Detail | Cryptographic Module Validation Program
See the consolidated validation certificate also on the NIST website.
Key points to enabling FIPS
There are several things that you must understand when you enable FIPS on Splunk Enterprise:

You must enable FIPS mode before you start Splunk Enterprise. FIPS mode is disabled except when it runs on a Linux machine that runs a kernel in FIPS mode.
FIPS is automatically enabled if you run Splunk software on a Linux machine that runs a kernel in FIPS mode.
The FIPS module disables the use of some cryptographic algorithms in the instance of Python that Splunk software uses to run apps (such as Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4).
Any Splunk apps you want to run on a FIPS-enabled instance must be certified to run in FIPS mode and cannot have dependencies on algorithms like MD5 or RC4.
Enable FIPS
Always enable FIPS mode upon initial Splunk software installation. If you install the software without FIPS mode enabled, you cannot later upgrade it to a FIPS version, and must either reinstall, or install a new version.

Before you start Splunk Enterprise for the first time, use a text editor to edit the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/splunk-launch.conf configuration file.
Add the following line to the file:
SPLUNK_FIPS=1
Start Splunk software. It enables FIPS mode during the installation.
Use indexes with FIPS enabled
Running Splunk in FIPS mode does not alter indexed data in any way. You can copy indexes between FIPS and non-FIPS indexers.

Confirm FIPS mode status
You can use the CLI, a REST endpoint, or Splunk search to determine whether or not the Splunk instance is in FIPS mode.

The following CLI command returns FIPS mode status:

splunk show fips-mode -auth <username>:<password>
If FIPS mode is enabled, the CLI command returns FIPS mode enabled.
Otherwise, it returns FIPS mode disabled.
The following REST call returns FIPS mode status:

curl -s -k -u admin:changeme https://localhost:8089/services/server/info | grep fips_mode
If FIPS mode is enabled, this call returns the following:

<s:key name="fips_mode">1</s:key>
The following Splunk search returns FIPS mode status:

"| rest splunk_server=local /services/server/info | fields fips_mode"

If FIPS mode is enabled, the search returns the following:

fips_mode
---------
        1
Troubleshoot FIPS
If you are in FIPS mode and your usual RSA encrypted private keys do not work, they might be incompatible with FIPS. To mitigate this issue, you can convert your Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) private key to PKCS#8 format to make them compatible.
After you install Splunk software without FIPS mode enabled, you cannot enable FIPS mode. If you require FIPS compliance, confirm that your initial Splunk installation is FIPS-enabled. To change to a version running FIPS mode, reinstall Splunk software and use the procedure in this topic to enable FIPS.
If you have problems running a Splunk app, confirm that it is certified to run in FIPS mode and does not have dependencies on cryptographic algorithms that FIPS disables (such as MD5 and RC4).


About default certificate authentication
Splunk Enterprise 6.6 and higher comes with default certificates that are signed with Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)-256 using a 2048-bit key. These certificates are part of a fresh installation.

When you upgrade from a previous release, Splunk Enterprise replaces the existing cacert.pem.default and ca.pem.default Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) files. Existing certificates, for example cacert.pem and ca.pem, are not affected.

Because of the new default PEM, you must upgrade all certificates and PEM files to SHA-256 using a 2048-bit key to avoid validation errors. For example, your indexers and forwarders might require updates to meet the same standards as your Splunk Enterprise instance. You might also want to check the certificate for your license manager. If all certificates and PEM files are not updated, Splunk Enterprise logs the following error in splunkd.log when it attempts to connect to another instance over SSL:

ERROR TcpOutputFd - Connection to host=10.140.130.102:9997 failed. sock_error = 0. 
SSL Error = error:04091077:rsaroutines:INT_RSA_VERIFY:wrong signature length

Harden your Windows installation
If you choose a directory that is outside of the Program Files directory on the drive that booted your Windows machine, that directory does not get the automatic protections that directories inside Program Files get.

Follow these instructions to ensure that Windows enforces the proper access controls to the Splunk software installation directory and that low-privilege users cannot access that folder.

Harden Splunk software installation directories with Windows Explorer
From an Explorer window, right click on the target installation folder and select Security > Advanced > Disable Inheritance > Remove all inherited permissions from this object.
Click Add > Select a principle > Administrator > Check Names.
Click OK.
Click Check full control.
Click OK.
Click Add > Select a principle > SYSTEM > Check Names.
Click OK.
Click Check full control.
Click OK.
Click Apply. then click OK
Harden Splunk software installation directories from a PowerShell window or command prompt
These instructions were tested and work as described on Windows versions 8.1 and higher, and Window Server versions 2008 R2 and 2012 R2. As an example, this procedure uses C:\Splunk as the installation directory.

Open a command prompt or PowerShell window.
Run the following command to break inheritance from parent directories.
C:\>icacls C:\Splunk /inheritance:d
Run the following command to remove the Users group from the directory.
C:\>icacls C:\Splunk /remove "Users" /T
Run the following command to remove the "Authenticated Users" group from the directory.
C:\>icacls C:\Splunk /remove "Authenticated Users" /T


Secure Splunk Enterprise on your network
Under certain conditions, Splunk Enterprise ports can become susceptible to attacks. Prevent access by shielding your Splunk Enterprise configuration from the Internet.

If possible, use a host-based firewall to restrict access to Splunkweb, management, and data ports. Keep Splunk Enterprise within a host-based firewall. Have your remote users access Splunk Enterprise on a Virtual Private Network.

You also can protect Splunk Enterprise from attacks in the following ways:

Restrict CLI security by restricting this port to local calls only, from behind a host firewall.
Unless necessary, do not allow access to forwarders on any port.
Install Splunk Enterprise on an isolated network segment that only trustworthy machines can access.
Limit port accessibility to only necessary connections. The necessary connections are:
End users and administrators must access Splunkweb (TCP port 8000 by default).
Search heads must access search peers on the management port (TCP port 8089 by default).
Deployment clients must access the deployment server on the management port (TCP port 8089 by default).
Forwarders must access the index server data port (TCP port 9997 by default).
Remote CLI calls use the management port.
Restrict access to the KV store port on the search head. (The KV store port, by default, is 8191, and by default that port is open to the network.) On each search head cluster member, allow access to the KV store port only for the other members, so that the cluster can replicate KV store data.


Disable unnecessary Splunk Enterprise components
For single-server Splunk Enterprise deployments:

Forwarders should not run Splunkweb and should not be configured to receive data on TCP or UDP ports or from other Splunk Enterprise instances.
For multiserver Splunk Enterprise deployments:

Search heads should not receive data on TCP or UDP ports or from other Splunk Enterprise instances.
If users are not logging in to Splunkweb on indexers in a distributed environment, Splunkweb should be disabled on the indexers.


Secure your service accounts
Practice the principle of least privilege by running Splunk software as an unprivileged user rather than using a privileged account such as root or Administrator.

On Unix or Linux, use the "splunk" user created with the PKG or RPM packages, or create your own user that only has privilege and ownership over $SPLUNK_HOME.
On Windows, the local system context is often the best choice. However, if you require communication using a windows communication channel, such as WMI, use a restricted access account.


Deploy secure passwords across multiple servers
At initial startup, Splunk Enterprise creates a file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/splunk.secret. This file contains a key used to encrypt some of your authentication information in configuration files. Each of the following files can be encrypted across a deployment using splunk.secret. Note that the passwords and encryption methods used for each file are not necessarily interchangeable.

web.conf: Your SSL passwords on every instance.
authentication.conf: Your LDAP passwords, if you have any.
inputs.conf: Your SSL passwords, if you use splunktcp-ssl to set up ssl for data distribution.
outputs.conf:: Your SSL passwords, if you use splunktcp-ssl to configure splunktcp-ssl in inputs.conf to set up ssl for data distribution.
server.conf: pass4symmkey, if you have one.
passwords.conf: Your password for a given app.
When Splunk software starts, if it detects a clear-text password, in one of these settings, it will create or overwrite the configuration in the equivalent local folder with the encrypted password.

Note: If the pass4symmkey or SSLPassword is specified in a default apps file, the password is obfuscated in the local version of the file upon restart. The default version of the file remains in clear text. However, if the file is listed using curl or a splunkd endpoint, the passwords appear encrypted.

When you deploy Splunk software on multiple servers, you must encrypt the passwords and ensure that they are consistent across your deployment. Splunk recommends that you use an encryption tool such as Vault's "secret/*" to secure your passwords as you distribute them.

You should perform these steps at initial deployment and also any time you need to deploy a new password for your instances:

1. Using your encryption tool, deploy the passwords to all servers.

2. On each server, place the password, in clear text, in the relevant file.

3. Immediately start/restart to encrypt all the passwords under the server's unique secret.

In a search head cluster, the captain replicates its splunk.secret file to all other cluster members during initial deployment of the cluster, so you do not need to copy it manually. As part of its normal operation, the cluster also automatically replicates any credentials that are stored by apps for their own use.

Harden your KV store port
We recommend that you secure your environment by restricting KV store access to your port. By default, port 8191 is opened to the network. We recommend that you restrict this port when possible.

For search head clustering, you should open the port only to other members of the cluster so that other members can replicate KV store data.

For more information about working with KV store, see About the app key value store


Some best practices for your servers and operating system
Operating System
To maximize security, harden the operating system on all computers where you run Splunk software.

If your organization does not have internal hardening standards, consult the CIS hardening benchmarks.
As a minimum, limit shell/command line access to your Splunk servers.
Splunk
Configure redundant Splunk instances, both indexing a copy of the same data.
Backup Splunk data and configurations, regularly.
Execute a periodic recovery test by attempting to restore Splunk Enterprise from backup.
Verify your Splunk download using a hash function such as MD5 to compare the hashes. For example:
./openssl dgst md5 <filename-splunk-downloaded.zip>

Client browser
Use a current version of a supported browser, such as Firefox or Internet Explorer.
Use a client-side JavaScript blocker such as noscript on Firefox or Internet Explorer 8 Filters to help protect against XSS, XSRF, and similar exploits.
Ensure that users have the latest Flash version installed.
Physical security
Secure physical access to all Splunk servers.
Ensure that Splunk end users practice sound physical and endpoint security.
Set a short time-out for Splunk Web user sessions. See Configure timeouts for more information.
More opportunities to secure your configuration
Use a configuration management tool, such as subversion, to provide version control for Splunk configurations.
Integrate Splunk configuration changes into your existing change management framework.
Configure Splunk Enterprise to monitor its own configuration files and alert on changes.

An Analytic Story is comprised of narrative that provides an assessment of the Security Threat and how it helps detect and investigate it using Splunk Enterprise Security. In addition it provides a Summary of how the story maps to the following:

ATT&ck, an adversary behavior model that describes the actions an adversary might take.
Kill-Chain, a model that identifies the phases an adversary must complete to achieve their objective.
CIS Critical Security Controls
Data Models that are referenced within the searches and that need to be populated.
Technologies, example technologies that map to the data models used in Splunk ES.
References, external sources supporting analytic story research.
An Analytic Story includes the following searches that fall into one of four categories:

Detection searches identify indicators of a potential threat.
Context searches advise you on context-specific asset and identify information that you need to gather for an investigation.
Investigative searches advise you on the additional information you need to gather to investigate a threat and determine its impact within your environment.
Supporting searches support the detection searches.
Select any search to view its search name, description, kill chain phase, and details.

Configure an Analytic Story in Splunk Enterprise Security
From the Detection search, select Configure in ES to set up the Detection search as a correlation search in Enterprise Security. Any modification to the SPL performed within the Analytic Story view must be copied over manually.
To add the Context and Investigate searches as Adaptive Response actions for notable events generated by the Detection search:
Add the ESCU-Context response action to run context searches associated with the analytic story and streamline the investigation process.
Add the ESCU-Investigate response action to run investigation searches associated with the analytic story.
Click Save.
Feedback Center
Access the Feedback Center to send feedback directly to the Splunk security research team. Use the feedback form to request help with a specific analytic story or make suggestions for new analytic stories or searches. The Splunk security research team reviews all submissions.

To use the Feedback Center, your search head must be configured with mail server details. See Configure email notification for your Splunk instance in the Splunk Enterprise Alerting Manual.

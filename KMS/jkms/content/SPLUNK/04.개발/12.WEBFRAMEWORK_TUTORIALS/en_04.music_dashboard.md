Music Dashboard app

We'll start out by creating a dashboard with some basic Splunk visualizations, then build on that by adding some cool features from third-party tools. If you're a JavaScript developer, you'll see that you can use the tools and technologies you already work with to create rich and compelling Splunk apps.

Here's what we'll do in this tutorial:

Create the app, including the project directory structure and files.
Build a basic dashboard by using the built-in Dashboard Editor, then convert the dashboard to HTML.
Add an accordion widget from the jQuery UI library.
Add a Sankey diagram, which is a D3 visualization.
Make the dashboard views interactive.
Display images from a web service using Splunk data.

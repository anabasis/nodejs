Display data with Splunk views
The Web Framework includes a library of Splunk views, which are the UI widgets and form controls that you put on your pages to display a certain type of information, or control some aspect of a search or another view. Splunk views are designed to work with search managers, so they automatically know how to work with them. But mostly, views let you quickly and easily run searches and display results on your page. (In Simple XML, these items are referred to as form inputs and panel visualization elements).

The Web Framework includes views for:

# Using Splunk Enterprise Security

## 3. Investigations

### Objectives

- Use investigations to manage incident response activity
- Use the investigation timeline
- Add items to investigations

### Investigations

- An investigation is a collection of activities and notes related to work done on a specific issue, such as a breach or other incident
- Investigations are organized chronologically into timelines
- Investigations can be managed by one or more analysts
- Use investigations to:
  - Visualize progress
  - Document work
  - Share information

### Starting an Investigation

- You can create a new investigation:
  - From the Incident Review dashboard’s Actions menu
  - On the Investigations dashboard
  - From any ES dashboard using the Investigation Bar at the bottom of the ES window
  - When searching raw events, from the Event Actions menu
- By default, only ess_admin and ess_analyst users can create investigations
- Each investigation has one owner and can have any number of additional collaborators
- Only owners and collaborators can modify the investigation

### Scenario: Data Exfiltration

- Customers have reported unauthorized use of their account numbers (from your store)
- Start an investigation and begin researching the issue
1. Create a note describing the situation and how you were notified
2. Examine notable events related to the payment processing system and add them to the investigation
3. Run ad-hoc searches and add the results to the timeline
4. Add notes  periodically to explain why you ran searches and what you found in the results
5. Add notes detailing actions taken to mitigate the breach and close the vulnerability

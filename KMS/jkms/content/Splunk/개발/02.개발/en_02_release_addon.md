Package your app
An easy way to deploy your Splunk app (or add-on) to other computers is to install the app from a package. A packaged app is is a compressed tar archive (a .tar.gz tarball) with the .spl file extension that includes the dashboards, reports, scripted and modular inputs, field extractions, workflow actions, lookups, event types, and other objects in your app. Users can install your packaged app directly using Splunk Web or the command line, and organizations can use deployment tools to distribute apps to their users.

The Packaging Toolkit provides tools for authoring, packaging, and validating a Splunk app to help improve app management, including installation, configuration, and updating the app.

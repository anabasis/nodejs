Splunk REST API
Splunk provides a fully-documented and supported REST API with over 200 endpoints. Developers can programmatically index, search, and visualize data in Splunk from any application.

Splunk Software Development Kits (SDKs)
The Splunk SDKs are built as a layer on top of the Splunk REST API. These SDKs include documentation, code samples, resources, and tools to make it faster and more efficient to program against the Splunk REST API using constructs and syntax familiar to developers experienced with Java, Python, JavaScript, and C#. In just a few lines of code, developers can easily manage HTTP access, authentication, and namespaces.

Developers can use the Splunk SDKs to:

Run real-time searches and retrieve Splunk data from line-of-business systems such as Customer Service applications.
Integrate data and visualizations (charts, tables) from Splunk into BI tools and reporting dashboards.
Build mobile applications with real-time KPI dashboards and alerts powered by Splunk.
Log directly to Splunk from remote devices and applications via TCP, UDP, and HTTP.
Build customer-facing dashboards in applications powered by user-specific data in Splunk.
Manage a Splunk instance, including adding and removing users as well as creating data inputs from an application outside of Splunk.
Programmatically extract data from Splunk for long-term data warehousing.

Developer tools
Splunk empowers developers to optimize their productivity and write great code using any technology platform, language, framework or approach.

Splunk offers tooling support for:

Visual Studio: .NET developers can use the Splunk extension for Visual Studio to build applications that use and extend Splunk. The extension simplifies creating projects using the Splunk SDK for C#. Additionally, the Splunk extension for Visual Studio includes support for creating modular inputs to extend Splunk and allow it to talk to additional data sources such as other internal systems or public APIs like Google, Facebook and Twitter.
Eclipse IDE: The Splunk plug-in for Eclipse contains a project template for building a new Splunk SDK for Java application. This is ideal for building an application that searches against Splunk data or does automation. The project template includes snippets for performing common SDK tasks, as well as infrastructure for wiring up the application to log application data directly to Splunk utilizing popular log frameworks like Apache log4j.
Splunk also provides logging libraries that allow you to log activity from your .NET, Java, or JavaScript application directly back to Splunk Enterprise:

Splunk logging for .NET
Splunk logging for Java
Splunk logging for JavaScript
The Splunk SDK for Java has built-in support for IntelliJ for easy integration. SpringSource introduced the Spring Integration Extension for Splunk, making it easier for developers using the popular Java framework Spring to log directly to Splunk from their applications.

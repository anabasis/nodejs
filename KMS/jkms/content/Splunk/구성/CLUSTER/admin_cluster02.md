# Splunk Cluster Administration 7.0

## Module 2: Single-site Indexer Cluster

### Module Objectives

- Describe how Splunk single-site indexer clusters work
- Identify cluster components and terms
- Implement a single-site indexer cluster
- Search and review internal logs related to indexer clustering

### Single-site Indexer Cluster Overview

- Master node
  - There can only be one master
  - Controls and manages index replication
  - Distributes peer nodes apps and configurations to
- Peer nodes
  - Indexes data from inputs/forwarders
  - Replicates instructed by data the to master other peer nodes as
- Search head
  - Works head the same as any Splunk search
  - Required component of indexer cluster
- Forwarders
  - Send data to peer nodes

Index Replication cluster
Search Head
Master Node Distributed search
Data replication
Peer Nodes
Forwarder with useACK enabled

### Indexer Cluster Considerations

Benefits

- Data availability and fast recovery
- Easier overall administration
  - Coordinated indexer configuration management
  - Automatic distributed search setup
  - Elastic indexer discovery
  - Indexer peer node status dashboard on the master node
- Scale-out indexing capacity
- No additional cost for data replication

Trade Offs

- Increased storage requirements
- Increased processing load
  - Depending on the replication & search factors
- Requires additional Splunk instances 
  - Replication factor + CM + SH
- No support for heterogeneous indexers
  - Requires same OS and Splunk versions
- Requires cluster-specific deployment management

### Indexer Cluster System Requirements

- Each node must run on its own host
  - The master node must run the same or a later version than the peer nodes and search heads
  - The search heads must run the same or a later version than the peer nodes
  - All peer nodes must run EXACTLY the same version
- Peer node storage requirements should:
  - Be able to sustain 800 IOPS for each peer node   - Use fast attached storage or storage area networks (SAN) over fiber
    - The ratio of disks to disk controllers should mimic a database system requirement
- Cluster recovery time depends upon system resources available on master node

<http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/Systemrequirements>

### Indexer Cluster Deployment Overview

1. Identify your clustering requirements
  - Replication policy, disk space, number of peer nodes, etc.
2. Install Splunk Enterprise and configure cluster instances
  - One master, at least two indexers, and one search head
3. Enable clustering on each cluster instance
  - Use Splunk Web UI, CLI, or manually edit server.conf
4. Create and distribute configuration bundles to the peer nodes
5. Forward data to the peer nodes

### Best Practices and Guidelines

- Plan, plan, and plan
  - A single cluster or segregated clusters (by sourcetype, department, or use case)
- Cluster instances should not share hardware
  - Dedicate hardware to the master node, search head, and peer nodes
  - All members share the same license pool
  - Each peer node must have its own storage
- Number of peer nodes is determined by:
  - Expected availability requirements of your organization
  - Level of replication required, daily data rate, retention policy, and concurrent users
    -Index replication does not increase your licensing usage
- Cannot use a deployment server to distribute configuration bundles directly to peer nodes

### Where to Install the Master Node

- On a dedicated host
  - Cannot be shared with a peer node or search head instance
  - Search capabilities are for debugging purposes
- Under certain limited circumstances, it can fulfill additional server roles
  - Built-in search head for debugging purposes
  - Monitoring Console
  - Deployer
  - License master

Note  Master node failover is discussed later in this module.

Note When hosting additional roles, the cluster should be under the following limits:

- 30 indexers
  - 10 indexes
  - 100,000 buckets
- 10 search heads

### Single-site Cluster: Key Specifications

- Peer nodes copy buckets to other peer nodes (index replication)
  - The copied buckets may be searchable buckets or contain only rawdata
- Replication factor
  - Specifies how many total copies of rawdata the cluster should maintain
  - Sets the total failure tolerance level
- Search factor
  - Specifies how many copies are searchable
    - Searchable buckets have both rawdata and index files
  - Cannot be larger than the replication factor
  - Determines how quickly you can recover the search capability
    - A trade-off between disk usage and search availability
- Security key (pass4SymmKey)
  - Authenticates communication between the cluster nodes
  - The key must be the same across all cluster instances

### Estimating Disk Usage

- Total rawdata disk usage = Rawdata total * replication factor
  - Assuming rawdata on disk = ~ 15% of indexed data
- Total index disk usage = Index data total * search factor
  - Assuming index files on disk = ~35% of indexed data

|Daily Index data = 100GB|RF=3 & SF=2 on 3 peer nodes|RF=3 & SF=2 on 6 peer nodes|RF=3 & SF=3 on 6 peer nodes|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Rawdata (15% of 100GB)|15 * 3 = 45 GB|15 * 3 = 45 GB|15 * 3 = 45 GB|
|Index files (35% of 100GB)|35 * 2 = 70 GB|35 * 2 = 70 GB|35 * 3 = 105 GB|
|Total size across cluster|115 GB|115 GB|150 GB|
|Per Peer storage per day|115 / 3 = 38.3 GB|115 / 6 = 19 GB|150 / 6 = 25 GB|

### Configuring Splunk Cluster

- There are three ways to configure
  - Splunk Web, CLI, and server.conf
  - In this course, you will use CLI for configurations and Splunk Web for monitoring
- Enable clustering on the instances in the order of Master node > Peer nodes > Search heads
- Get help on Splunk cluster commands:
  - splunk help cluster
  - splunk help [list|edit] cluster-config

pass4SymmKey.

### Configuring Splunk Master Node

Enter the single command
- Splunk defaults to: > splunk edit cluster-config -mode master -replication_factor 2
  - replication_factor = 3
  - search_factor = 2 -search_factor 2 -secret mycluster
- The secret parameter is encrypted and saved as
Results in: SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf
[clustering] mode = master replication_factor = 2 pass4SymmKey = Hashed_Secret
pass4SymmKey
  - Starting in 6.6, a non-default security key is required
  - mycluster is set as the password for this cluster example

### Configuring the Peer Nodes

> splunk enable listen 9997 > splunk edit cluster-config -mode slave
- Ports required on each peer:
  - Receiving port to listen to forwarders -master_uri https://10.0.1.3:8089 -secret mycluster -replication_port 9100
  - Replication port to communicate with
other peer nodes
- In this example:
SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf
[clustering]
  - 9997 = the forwarder listening port   - 10.0.1.3 = master node address
mode = slave master_uri = https://10.0.1.3:8089 pass4SymmKey = Hashed_Secret
  - 8089 = master node's splunkd-port   - mycluster = same cluster password
[replication_port://9100]
  - 9100 = index replication port

### Configuring the Search Head

> splunk edit cluster-config
- To configure as a cluster search head: -mode searchhead -master_uri https://10.0.1.3:8089
  - 
-secret mycluster
edit cluster-config
- Functions as a regular search head
- For more help: SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf
splunk help [list|add|edit|remove] [clustering] mode = searchhead
cluster-master
master_uri = https://10.0.1.3:8089 pass4SymmKey = Hashed_Secret1

### Adding SH to an Additional Indexer Cluster

> splunk add cluster-master
- SHs can belong to multiple clusters -master_uri https://20.0.2.6:8089 -secret yourCluster
- To allow SH to search additional clusters:
splunk add cluster-master
SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf
[clustering] mode = searchhead master_uri = clustermaster:10.0.1.3:8089, clustermaster:20.0.2.6:8089
[clustermaster:10.0.1.3:8089] master_uri = https://10.0.1.3:8089 pass4SymmKey = Hashed_Secret1
[clustermaster:20.0.2.6:8089] master_uri = https://20.0.2.6:8089 pass4SymmKey = Hashed_Secret2

### Index Replication Health

Cluster status is When current operational RF is When current operational SF is Complete Met as specified Met as specified Valid One or greater
- With replication factor = 3 and search factor = 2:
  - A complete cluster has 3 copies of each bucket, 2 of which are searchable   - A valid cluster has at least one searchable copy of all buckets
- With replication factor = 2, search factor = 2, and 2 peers:
  - A complete cluster has 2 searchable buckets, each having its copy of
rawdata   - A valid cluster has at least one searchable copy of all buckets

### Notable Indexer Cluster Log Channels

- Cluster peers communicate via the /service/cluster endpoints
  - Peer to master communication: /services/cluster/master   - Master to peer communication: /services/cluster/slave
- splunkd_access.log   - Indexer cluster communication logs
  - Example:
index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_access (uri="/services/cluster/slave/buckets*" OR uri="/services/cluster/master/buckets*") | convert ctime(_time) | table _time uri_path | sort _time
  - Higher response time indicates service overloading   - Response status 200 is good, anything else is not good
- splunkd.log   - indexer clustering activity logs   - component=CM* OR component=Cluster*   - Look for WARN/ERROR on the host=<master>
- metrics.log
  - component=Metrics group=clusterout_connections

### Master Node Failover

- If the master node is lost, the cluster continues to operate
  - New data arriving at peer nodes is indexed, but might not replicate
  - The search heads continue to send the queries to last known list of peer nodes and peer nodes will respond if they can
  - After the master node comes back online, buckets are re-balanced
- A stand-by master node can be configured
  - http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/Handlemasternodefailure
- You can employ DNS-based failover, a load balancer, or some other technique to switch the same master_uri to the stand-by master
  - Hot-standby is NOT recommended

### Master Node Failover (cont.)

- A standby master only needs the primary master's static state information
  - SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf
  - SPLUNK_HOME/etc/master-apps
- When the standby master node starts, its services are blocked until it can fulfill the replication factor
  - To have the standby master unblock immediately, run: splunk set indexing-ready

Note
Extra provisioning is required if the Monitoring Console is also enabled on the Master Node.

### Restarting Indexer Cluster

- Ordinarily you do not restart the entire cluster
  - Search heads can be restarted at any time
- If you do need to restart the entire cluster:

1. Restart the master node with splunk restart
2. Wait and check the master node dashboard for cluster status
3. Run splunk rolling-restart cluster-peers ê Performs a phased restart of all the peer nodes ê Restarts 10% of the peers at a time in random order (configurable) ê To cause all peers to restart immediately, run from the master:

> splunk edit cluster-config -percent_peers_to_restart 100 > splunk rolling-restart cluster-peers

### Migrating Non-clustered Indexers to a Cluster

- You can add a non-clustered indexer to a cluster as a peer node at any time splunk edit cluster-config -mode slave ...
- Apps must be re-distributed via master-apps
  - 
Note
You cannot convert a peer node to a non-clustered indexer.
You will learn about distributing apps in indexer clusters in Module 4
- Only new data coming into this peer is replicated
  - New data follows the cluster's replication factor
- Existing buckets are not replicated
  - Contact Splunk Professional Services if you must replicate legacy buckets

### Upgrading and Applying Maintenance Releases

- To upgrade a single-site indexer cluster, you must take down the entire cluster at once and upgrade all node tiers in order:
  - Master node > search heads > peer nodes   - Within each tier, upgrade all nodes as a single operation
- Maintenance updates can be applied in a rolling, online upgrade
  - No need to bring down the entire cluster at once   - Upgrade the tiers in the same prescribed order
ê Put the master into maintenance mode while upgrading the peer nodes ê To take down peer nodes, use the splunk stop command ê We will discuss maintenance mode command later http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/Upgradeacluster
